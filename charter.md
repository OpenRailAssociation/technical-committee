# Charter of the Technical Committee of the OpenRail Foundation

*This is a draft*

## Objectives

The OpenRail Foundation's Technical Committee (TC) is responsible for selecting and overseeing the Foundation's projects to ensure that they are aligned with the Foundation's goals and values. The committee works in collaboration with the Board of Directors to make informed decisions on which projects to support and provides the necessary guidance to ensure their success.

## Principles

* True to open source values - Projects shall be run according to proven open source principles and values.
* Equal access - Projects shall be run in a way which provides equal access to all contributors. Decisions should be taken based on the merit of a contribution and the alignment with the goals of the project not based on status or affiliation of the contributors.
* Transparency - Projects shall operate in a transparent way. This applies to development as well as decisions around the project.

## Composition of the TC

The TC is composed of:

* One representative of each Platinum member. The representative of the Platinum member to the OpenRail Foundation designates the representative in the TC. The designation can be changed at any time.
* One representative of each project hosted by the OpenRail Foundation. The representative for each project is designated by the maintainers of the corresponsping project. The representative should be a maintainer or another active member of the project. The designation can be changed at any time.

## Chair of the TC

The Chair of the TC is elected once a year from among the TC members. The Chair is responsible for ensuring that meetings are conducted according to the rules described below, and for communicating the decisions made at these meetings to the Board and the wider Openrail Foundation community.

The current TC Chair is responsible for running the election of the next TC Chair and remains responsible for the TC Chair duties until the next TC Chair is elected.

Each member of the TC has one vote for electing the chair. The candidate who gets the most votes is elected as a chair. If there is a tie between multiple candidates having the same number of most votes, another round of voting is done between the candidates which are tied. This is repeated until a single candidate gets the most votes.

## Meetings

The TC will meet regularly to discuss proposed projects and make decisions. Meetings can be in person or online. Agendas and protocols of meetings should be made available publicly. The TC can choose to open meetings to people not being members of the TC.

## Decisions

The TC should strive to take decisions consensually. The default decision mechanism is consent. If that does not result in a decision, the TC falls back to a vote, where each TC member has one vote. In case of a tie the TC Chair decides.

## Incubation process 

### Project selection procedure

Projects will be submitted to the Foundation for evaluation by the Technical Committee. Projects will be evaluated on criteria such as their alignment with the Foundation's goals and values, their potential impact on the community, their technical feasibility and their ability to be sustained in the long term. The committee will then decide whether the project will be proposed to the Board of Directors to be hosted by the Foundation or not.

### Life cycle of projects

The TC defines criteria and a process to define the maturity of a project and how a project transitions between different maturity stages. This should include:

* General criteria and requirements to be fulfilled by all projects
* Maturity stages and which specific criteria and requirements have to be fulfilled on which maturity stage
* A procedure to retire inactive, unmaintained, or obsolete projects

## Project guidance

The committee will provide guidance to help approved projects achieve their objectives. The TC ensures that projects are run according to open governance principles and that they respect the goals and values of the Foundation. Within these boundaries projects should have the freedom to operate independently and define their own governance. The TC provides templates and best practices to support projects to implement their governance.

Projects are required to define at least one maintainer and a procedure how this maintainer is chosen and how maintainership is transitioned when a maintainer steps away from the maintainer role.

## Modification of the rules of procedure

These rules of procedure may be amended by the Technical Committee in consultation with the Foundation. The TC proposes changes to the Board of Directors which validates them.
