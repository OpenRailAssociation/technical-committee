- Each project must include a link to its project README in the "Further Information" section, similar to last year’s format.
- At least one image (e.g., a screenshot) per project is encouraged to enhance visual appeal.

**Deadline:**
All content should be submitted by **February 13, 2026**. Projects can send drafts to Peter for initial reviews.
