# Meeting on 2025-07-29

Present: Cornelius, Florian, Stephanie, Max

## Agenda

* Consequences of CRA for OpenRail Association (as Open Source Software Steward)
* Hosting of osrd-ui

## Protocol

* We may be obligated to take actions in the future. Some open-source organizations are involved in discussions. [More information can be found here](https://github.com/ossf/wg-globalcyberpolicy/blob/main/documents/CRA/checklists/OSS_Stewards_Obligations_Checklist.md)
  We will likely need to adapt our SECURITY.md template. Cornelius will follow up on this topic. As the Technical Committee, we take responsibility for addressing security and legal requirements.
* The `osrd-ui` repository will be archived. We have two options to host the storybook website:
  1. Create a new "fake" repository to host our HTML (using github pages).
  2. Host it on OpenRailAssociation servers and crate a ui.osrd.fr subdomain.
We will proceed with the second option as it is cleaner. Max will assist in setting everything up.
