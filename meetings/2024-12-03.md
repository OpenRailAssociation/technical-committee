# TC Meeting 2024-12-03

Present: Florian, Frederik, Tristram, Peter, Loïc, Max,

## Notes

- Stage 2:
  - [OpenSSF](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/issues/153):
    - Threshold of 5/10 (Aggregate score)
    - Should be run once for the stage application. Most of the criteria won't change (except vulnerabilities).
    - The project can argue why OpenSSF has incorrectly scored certain criteria, in order to increase the score manually.
  - [Security review](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/issues/148):
    - Projects MUST have a process to find vulnerabilities and fix it automatically.
    - Projects MUST have a `SECURITY.md` file that explain how to report security issues.
    - Add both checks to the `stage2.md` application which tool and process the project is using (dependabot or other)...
  - [Reuse](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/issues/155)
    - Max will add documentation on how it should be setup
  - [Open Communication](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/issues/154)
    - Ask for open roadmap and communication. The project can show why its communication is open (could be matrix server / open issues and PR)...
    - The project practices should be evaluated by the TC.

- FOSDEM:
  - Max is not an organizer/admin (this will be checked with Peter)

- Board of director:
  - Maybe a new project (about train localisation) could be presented? (Matias InfraBel)
  - We could have a new candidate from SNCF: (API for [FRMCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRMCS))
