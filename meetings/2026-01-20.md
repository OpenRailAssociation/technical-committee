## Minutes

### Discussion on Project Governance

Workshops on project governance have already taken place. The suggestions and outcomes will be discussed in a future meeting, pending some preparation.

The following resources were identified for further discussion and drafting:
- [OpenRail Association: Open-Sourcing Practices](https://projects.openrailassociation.org/docs/practices/open-sourcing/)
- [Technical Committee PR #296](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/pull/296/changes)
- Apache Software Foundation’s governance model, known for its strong and well-established focus on governance
- [Linux Magazin: Open Source Synergies](https://www.linux-magazin.de/ausgaben/2023/09/open-source-synergien/)

The next discussion on this topic is scheduled for **February 3, 2026**.

### Agenda for the Next Election of the Chair

A reminder was given that the election for the TC chair will take place **next week**, at the beginning of the meeting.
It seems like we will have only one candidate, so those who are absent can either vote by proxy or just trust the committee for next week.

### Communication About Open Source (OS) in Companies

Currently, communication about open source within companies is primarily driven by individual initiatives. Some companies organize events or have internal communities focused on open source, such as DB, which also engages with other communities like the Linux Foundation.

A proposal was made to organize a workshop to:
- Share experiences, including how sovereignty can be leveraged as an opportunity to adopt open source projects.
- Discuss potential strategies to grow the community and encourage broader adoption.

Peter shared a slide on the project scouting group. There is two key topics for him:
- How to transition existing projects toward open source, targeting product owners and teams.
- How to allocate funding for open source initiatives, targeting management.

### Reminder for the Annual Report

The first draft of the annual report should be available by the **end of January**. Cornelius and Adrian will open issues with assigned tasks to ensure timely reminders.
