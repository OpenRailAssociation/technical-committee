## Minutes

### Annual Report for 2025

Cornelius and Peter will collaborate on the annual report, with contributions welcome from others. A draft/skeleton is already available [here](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/annual-report/pull/42). Each project is responsible for completing its section in the provided Markdown file.

This year, projects are encouraged to focus on specific key points rather than providing a general description. The file suffix indicates which project should complete each section. The deadline for the first draft is the end of January. Ideas and suggestions are welcome.

### Metrics Report

The metrics report will be a separate document from the annual report. The goal is to produce quarterly reports with a consistent structure. These reports will be published on the organization’s website.

### AI Policy for AI-Generated Contributions

The group discussed the need for a general policy regarding AI-generated contributions within the OpenRail Association. There is a spectrum of possible rules to consider, including whether contributors should disclose when their pull requests (PRs) are fully or partially AI-generated.

The Linux Foundation has already established a policy on this matter, which can be found [here](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/generative-ai). The team agreed to review existing policies before developing their own. There is no immediate rush to finalize this policy.

### Agenda for the Next Technical Committee (TC) Chair Election

This topic was not discussed due to time constraints.
