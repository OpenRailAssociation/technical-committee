# TC Meeting 2024-09-24

Present: Florian, Tristram, Cornelius, Stephanie, Adrian; Excused: Frederik, Max, Loic, Peter

## Agenda

* Onboarding (https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/labels/Onboarding)
* Project badges (https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/issues/42)
* OpenSSF Scorecard (https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/issues/153)

## Protocol

* Onboarding: OSRD and RCM OSS are now complete, other projects work in progress tracked in the issues
* Project badges: The shields.io badges work well for integrating in the projects. We will continue with setting them up and documenting how to use them. The bigger badges (for presentations etc.) still need some discussion, also with the designers.
* OpenSSF Scorecard
  * Checks would be really useful. Maybe it's too much to add them to the CI as most of the criteria don't change very often.
  * What programming languages does the tool support?
  * There are also other tools doing similar things, where is it useful to rely on this tool or where are other alternatives?
  * The scorecard tool seems to check that checks are setup and does not do the checks itself.
  * We need to test the checking tool and see how it works in our context.
  * Please comment in the issue with your thoughts and what you find out. We will take the decision later when we have a clear understanding of the scorecard and the tooling.
* We skip the call next week because of vacations and Dreil√§nderhack
