## Minutes

### Discussion on Project Governance

The team discussed potential conflicts arising from contributors having different goals within projects. The focus was on finding ways to optimize collaboration and align efforts.

It was suggested that current maintainers draft governance principles and share them with other contributors for feedback. This would help ensure the principles are suitable for effective collaboration.

There was agreement on the need to address these challenges, though specific solutions were not immediately identified. The group was open to exploring ideas further.

A proposal was made to create a list of questions that projects should address to improve visibility and clarity. Peter and Adrian volunteered to draft these questions and review them with the OSRD team. The final document will then be discussed at the TC committee to enhance the project’s documentation.

The group emphasized the importance of developing a governance framework that can scale with multiple contributors, visions, and goals. Clarifying the scope of maintainers’ roles was identified as a good starting point. Additionally, forming small working groups with representatives from different projects was suggested to foster collaboration.

### Reusing Material from the OpenRail Day

The team acknowledged the significant amount of material produced for the OpenRail Day and discussed reusing it for the website or other purposes. Loïc confirmed that all presentations are available and will be shared for reuse, provided they are reviewed to ensure they are free of internal comments. The PDF format was agreed upon for sharing.

Frederik inquired about attendance statistics. It was noted that there was an issue with the online invitation, resulting in approximately 35 online participants. In-person attendance was around 500 visitors. Pictures from the event will be uploaded to Nextcloud.

### Agenda for the Next Election of the Chair

The election for the TC chair is planned for January 27, 2026.
