## Protocol

* TC Report for the board meeting
  * Report is done: https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/pull/289/files?short_path=cd6096e#top modulo typo fixes. Will be shared via Loomio with board on Wednesday (Cornelius)
* Metrics report
  * Organization assignment is not exact. We should have a table to provide exact information from the point of view for who they are actually working
  * If we fix the organization view it's a valuable indicator for project activity, especially trends
  * What do we want to do with the data? It provides insight, we also use it in the OpenRail Team OKRs, input to annual report, fingerprint of projects (not as a measurement for driving the project, but as an indication of how it works)
  * Bitergia is doing this as supporting partner of the OpenRail Association
* OpenRail Day (https://day.openrailassociation.org)
  * Lots of interest in workshops (9:30-11:00)
  * Stands of projects in lobby (officials will come at 11:15)
  * Official presentations of the projects, keynotes and panel in the afternoon
  * Please register to get room
  * Each project stand will have a screen, a table and two seats
* FOSDEM
  * More submissions than last year, good proposals to choose from
  * Meeting on Wednesday of the organizing group to finalize the program
  * We will have to publish it on Monday
  * It's a community effort, broader than OpenRail, we want to be inclusive and give content visibility on the merits of the content
