# TC Meeting 2024-12-10

Present: Florian, Max, Loic, Tristram, Peter

## Agenda

- [Release process](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/issues/144)
  - Stage 2 aims for people to reuse the project.
  - Projects must document their release process.
  - Follow the [semver](https://semver.org/) guidelines. Especially for libraries.
  - Expect automation:
    - Security provided by the CI itself (github action can sign binaries)
    - Make release process independent from a single dev.
    - Ensure version-related commit hash.
    - Increase the trust users can have with the project.
- Tasks to define stage 2 requirements are assigned. ([here](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/milestone/5))
