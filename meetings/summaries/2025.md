## 2025 Technical Committee Summary

2025 has been a year of steady progress and growing maturity for the Technical Committee (TC), marked by strengthened governance, a more refined incubation framework, and gradual growth in the OpenRail project ecosystem.

The election of **Florian** as chair of the technical committee, **first representative of a project**, shows how the technical committee's governance matures.

The TC completed and formalized both Stage 2 and Stage 3 incubation criteria, enabling more consistent project evaluation. Incubation stages were renamed to **Onboarded → Qualified → Adopted**, providing clarity for members, contributors, and external partners. We published a breakdown and description of the capabilities of the railway system to help OpenRail projects and future users to meet up. Moving forward, the TC plans to make intensive use of these capabilities to map existing projects and identify new project opportunities across the rail ecosystem.

On the project side, several initiatives advanced significantly. **PopUpSim** was fully approved and integrated in **DAC migration DSS**; **Netzgrafik-Editor** (NGE) successfully migrated into the OpenRail ecosystem. Core projects such as **OSRD**, **NGE**, **RCM-OSS** and **LibLRS** made notable improvements, including new releases, features, documentation, and bug fixes.

For incubation candidates, **trainpositioning-lib** underwent licensing and technical review and **AMS** continued progressing toward a complete proposal. The TC also analyzed multiple Hack4Rail 2025 projects, identifying promising candidates for future incubation.

Infrastructure and tooling remained a strategic priority. The TC deployed an **OpenRail Matrix server** and **Nextcloud instance** with proper user management, initially launched to support Hack4Rail. The TC also refined hosting policies for **demo environments** and facilitated the successful deployment of the **OSRD demo instance**. Additionally, security templates were updated in anticipation of the Cyber Resilience Act.

Finally, the TC remained actively engaged in external outreach efforts, contributing to events and initiatives aimed at attracting new users and contributors to OpenRail projects. This included supporting the finalization of the 2024 Annual Report, contributing to preparations for OpenRail Day in Paris (December 2025), helping secure a FOSDEM Devroom to showcase community achievements, and presenting an overview of OpenRail at **FOSS Backstage** — a recorded session that now serves as a reusable resource for the TC's future presentations of OpenRail works.

With stronger processes, clearer governance, and growing industry engagement, the TC concludes 2025 well-positioned to support wider adoption of open source technologies across the rail sector.
