* Changes of Governance at Netzgrafik-Editor

  * Most importantly: new role "Business Domain Steward"
  * TODO for everyone: read through it, and give feedback by commenting the Pull Request
* Annual Report
  * Check issues appointed to you: https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/annual-report/issues
  * Fill the respective files by adding more text. Pre-existing content shall give you some inspiration
  * If you have it, graphic material (photos, illustrations etc) will be highly appreciated!
    * Ideally this would be permissively licensed or even "public domain". If unclear, ask Peter & Cornelius, they can figure it out
* Swiss public catalogue of Open Source Software
  * Public administration use YAML files for cataloguing and also offer some tooling

  * Peter is getting in touch with Cornelius who worked on publiccode.yaml in OpenRail previously
