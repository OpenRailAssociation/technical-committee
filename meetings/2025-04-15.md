# Meeting on 2025-04-15

Present: Adrian, Cornelius, Frederik, Max, Peter, Stephanie

## Agenda

* Onboarding
* Incubation process naming
* TC web site
* Annual report
 
## Protocol

* Onboarding Netzgrafikeditor
  * Adrian will get support to move the repo
* It would be generally helpful to document how the governance setup works in the relationship between open source project, which is hosted as neutral project within OpenRail, and the product where it's used internally by a company building on top of that for their own needs.
* Naming of incubation stages: Onboarded, Qualified, Adopted. Cornelius will update the pull request. We also will have to remember updating the references, such as the badges, when we do the change.
* We still have to finish https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/milestone/6. For the criteria of stage 3 we will get to a version which is good enough to try and revise it when we actually get a project to apply for this stage.
* For projects.openrailassociation.org, Max will sort out the subdomain and Cornelius will take care of the content changes.
* Annual report, final version is done as of today. Next step is to put it on the website (as https://openrailassociation.org/documents/OpenRail-Association-Annual-Report-2024.pdf), write a news entry, and make use of it in communication.
