# Stage 2: Incubation

*As a project intending to move to stage 2 of the OpenRail incubation process, please fill out this questionnaire and send it to the Technical Committee. See the [incubation process](../../incubation-process.md) for details about criteria and requirements for new projects and how it works to get new projects into the association.*

*Copy this template and fill in your answers to the questions in the sections below.*

*The document has two sections. In the first section you provide references and evidence that show that you fulfill the criteria for incubation stage 2. These will mostly be links to documentation and other sources of information which show that you fulfill the criteria. Feel free to add any additional information which helps to explain or interpret this information. The second section is a checklist the Technical Committee fills out when it evaluates the proposal.*

## Health metrics

*How to assess project health depends on the context of the concrete project. Please answer the questions below and add any additional explanations or data you see as useful to show that the project has a healthy community and development activity.*

### How many active contributors does the project have?

*An active contributor is a person who has repeatedly contributed over the last twelve months. Please provide the links to the GitHub contributors statistics (e.g., https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/osrd/graphs/contributors) or any equivalent references.*

### How many different organizations are contributing to the project?

*This can be reported by looking at the email addresses of contributors in the commit log.*

### How much is the project dependent on individual contributors?

*How high is the risk to a project should the most active people leave? This is called the [Contributor Absence Factor](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-contributor-absence-factor/), sometimes also referred to as bus factor.*


## Open governance

### What is the release process of the project?

*Please provide a link to a document which describes the release process. This should explain how changes are communicated, versioning schemes, signing of release artifacts, etc.*

*You can find an example here: https://osrd.fr/en/docs/guides/release/*

### How are decisions made in the project?

*Please provide a link to the GOVERNANCE.md file of the project. This should explain the decision making process, including how technical decisions are made such as accepting pull requests or deciding about technical architecture. The GOVERNANCE.md file should document the decision making process, which won't change very often. The CONTRIBUTING.md and possibly other files contain the more practical details, which will need continuous adaptation. These files can point to the GOVERNANCE.md to reference the decision making process.*

### What is the business roadmap of the project?

*Please provide a link to the roadmap of the project.*
*You can find an example here: https://osrd.fr/en/about/roadmap/*


## Adoption

### Where is the project used in production?

*Please provide links to references of production users or add equivalent information here.*

### If the project includes specifications, where are reference implementations for these specifications?

*Please provide a link to the reference implementation.*


## Licensing

### Is the project REUSE compliant?

*Does the project include licensing information according to the [REUSE standard](https://reuse.software)? Did you register your project with the REUSE API, and set up CI checks? Are contributors informed about this in your CONTRIBUTING.md? Please provide the link to the README where the REUSE badge is shown, the CI workflow for REUSE checks, as well as your CONTRIBUTING.md where the REUSE requirement is mentioned.*

### Does the project use the Developer Certificate of Origin?

*Do commits include "Signed-Off" trailers? Is the DCO bot enabled on the project? Are contributors informed about this in your CONTRIBUTING.md? Please provide a link to the commit history where the commits with the "Signed-Off" trailers are shown, as well as your CONTRIBUTING.md where the DCO requirement is mentioned.*


## Security

### Does the project use pinned dependencies everywhere?

*Please provide links to the files in which dependencies are defined*


### Does the project have an automatic dependency and vulnerability process?

*Does the project use tools like Dependabot or Renovate to check for outdated and vulnerable dependencies? Are security advisories automatically created, and pull requests automatically prepared? Please provide links to CI steps (if available) or past issues/pull requests which fixed dependency issues.*

### What's the OpenSSF Scorecard score of the project?

*Projects in this stage are required to reach at least 5/10 points. Please provide the full OpenSSF scorecard report. You may add information if you think the OpenSSF Scorecard tool made a false-positive/negative finding in one of the practices.*

*Please provide the link to the README where the OpenSSF scorecard score is communicated together with the date of the last check.*

### What is the security policy of the project?

*Please provide a link to the security policy of your project.*
