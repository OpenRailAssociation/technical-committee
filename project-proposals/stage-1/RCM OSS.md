## What other organizations in the world should be interested in this project?

Several Railway Companies have expresses an interest but nothing concrete for now. We are in regular discussions with Infrabel about RCM-DX.

## Why would this project be a good candidate for inclusion in the OpenRail Association?

The aim of RCM OSS is to make rail condition data easy to access, store and visualize. Therefore, RCM OSS is beneficial to railway companies as well as measurement system suppliers.

## What is the project's plan for growing in maturity if accepted within the OpenRail Association?

Being hosted by OpenRail would makes RCM OSS a neutral project for the railway sector and not only an SBB project.

## Which exact repositories you would transfer to the GitHub organization of the OpenRail Association?

The public repository [RCM DX Format Specification](https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/rcm-dx). 
Later on, the new open-scource developed code of the RCM-DX R/W library will be added into the same repository. The closed-source code of the viewer stays in a privat SBB repository.

## How is it decided if and when a pull request is merged?

Currently, we are reviewing the RCM-DX specification with Infrabel and we are generating and accepting the pull requests internally in agreement with Infrabel. Infrabel can also generate Pull requests. A process how to handle this in future has to be defined.

## How can someone become a committer or a maintainer to/of the project?

Not yet decided.
