Actually we have an internal process which is the same for internal and external contribution:

* Reviewer ask for a review by a maintainer before merging

For now, only the maintainers can make the final approval and merge the PR.

It is not decided yet. I assume that once we have a contributor that provide good work, he or she can be granted maintainer. But we prefer not to have too much maintainers.
