# Participating in the Technical Committee

The Technical Committee is the working body of the OpenRail Association which acts as a bridge between the organization and the projects. It runs the incubation process and supports projects to work as high quality open-source projects. The Technical Committee is a hands-on group which jointly does the overarching work necessary to support a healthy ecosystem of open source projects within the OpenRail Association.

Each project can send a representative into the Technical Committee. **As a project you need to name a person who gets invited to the weekly meetings of the Technical Committee** and has voting rights on decisions taken there. That said, almost all decisions are taken by consensus and those who do the actual work. We maintain a very collaborative culture there.

More information about the Technical Committee can be found in its [charter]({{< relref charter >}}). The group can be reached via email at technical-committee@openrailassociation.org.
