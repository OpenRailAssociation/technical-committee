# Onboarding a project as OpenRail project

Once an open source project officially is accepted as OpenRail project, it goes through an onboarding process. As part of this process the code is moved to the OpenRail Association, a representative of the project is added to the technical committee, and it's made sure that the project meets the minimal standards required by the OpenRail Association and is properly presented on the web site etc.

There is an [onboarding checklist](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/onboarding-new-project.md) which defines the steps to be done during onboarding in detail. The Technical Committee assigns a person as **onboarding partner** which works with the representative of the project through the checklist. [Onboarding progress](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AOnboarding) is tracked on GitHub as issues.

Part of the onboarding is a [license review]({{< ref license-review >}}) to make sure that all code hosted by the OpenRail Association is open source and there are no other licensing issues.
