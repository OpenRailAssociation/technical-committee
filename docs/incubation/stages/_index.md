# Progressing in the Incubation Process

The lifecycle of projects in the OpenRail Association is managed with the [incubation process]({{< relref "process" >}}). The first step is to get accepted as an OpenRail project:

* [Applying to become an OpenRail project]({{< relref "application" >}})

Once you are an OpenRail project you can progress within the incubation process while the project matures. The advanced stages signify a high project quality. On the highest stage projects become official recommendations of the OpenRail Association for production use cases in specific domains of the railway business.

The following guides describe activities on the various stages and how to advance to the next stage.

* [Activities at the Onboarded Stage]({{< relref "onboarded" >}})
* [Advancing to the Qualified Stage]({{< relref "qualified" >}})
* [Advancing to the Adopted Stage]({{< relref "adopted" >}})

A project which is not longer active and maintained is formally retired:

* [Retiring a project]({{< relref "retired" >}})

To indicate the status of a project you can use the [OpenRail Project Badges]({{< relref "badges" >}}).
