# Advancing to the Adopted stage

The Adopted stage is the most advanced and mature stage of the incubation process. This is for projects which have proven to have a great quality and adoption. These are the lighthouse projects the OpenRail Association recommends for production use throughout the industry.

Projects on the Adopted stage are required to have adopted these practices:

* [DCO]({{< relref dco >}})
* [REUSE]({{< relref reuse >}})
* SBOM generation for all release artifacts
