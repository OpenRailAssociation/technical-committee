# Badges

We provide a set of badges representing the status of projects in the OpenRail Association. They can be added to the README of a project and used in other locations where a quick visual indication that a project is part of the OpenRail Association or its stage in the incubation process is helpful.

Badges are hosted as SVG files on the OpenRail website. Use the following snippets to add them to markdown files:
