# Advancing to the Incubated stage

The Incubated stage is for projects which already have reached a high level of quality and are ready to be used in production. They have mature development practices and a solid base of contributors.

The goal of the Incubated stage is to make the project ready to be considered a standard solution in the domain the project operates in. This includes providing a healthy base of contributors and users from different organizations, putting the project on a broad and stable base.

Once the project has reached this level of adoption it's ready to move to the next stage, [Graduated]({{< ref graduated >}}).

Projects on the Incubated stage are required to have adopted these practices:

* [DCO]({{< ref dco >}})
* [REUSE]({{< ref reuse >}})
