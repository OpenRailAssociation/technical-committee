# Adopt good practices for projects

We strive to achieve a high degree of quality and maturity for open source projects hosted by the OpenRail Association. Our incubation process supports this by gradually setting requirements and recommendations for good practices to be adopted by projects. Requirements become stricter with advancing in the incubation process, so that the different incubation process stages transparently guarantee a certain level of maturity.

We generally orient ourselves at general good practices from the open source community. For some of the key practices we maintain specific documentation here:

* [DCO]({{< ref dco >}})
* [REUSE]({{< ref reuse >}})
* [Security]({{< ref security >}})
