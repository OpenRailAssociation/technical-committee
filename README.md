# Technical Committee of the OpenRail Association

This repository is the entry point for the work of the technical committee (TC) of the [OpenRail Association](https://openrailassociation.org/). It contains the charter of the TC and is meant as a working area to facilitate the work of the TC.

## Governance

The Technical Committee is the bridge between the organization and the projects. It manages the general technical process, such as the incubation process and the project governance. The goal is to have an environment where open source projects from the railway domain can flourish. The Technical Committee strives to find the right balance between keeping high standards to foster high quality projects and acting results-driven and pragmatic to allow for low-barrier access and fast progress.

Goals, principles and how it works are described in the [Charter](charter.md) of the Technical Committee.

## Members

The members of the Technical Committee are representatives of the projects plus up to three people  appointed by the board of the OpenRail Association.

The current members of the Technical Committee are:

* Cornelius Schumacher (DB Systel, appointed), Chair of the Technical Committee
* Loic Hamelin (SNCF Réseau, appointed)
* Peter Keller (SBB, appointed)
* Florian Amsallem (OSRD)
* Stephanie Schalbetter (RCM OSS)
* Frederik Schäfer (DAC Migration DSS)
* Adrian Egli (Netzgrafik-Editor)
* Tristram Gräbener (liblrs)

## Meetings

The Technical Committee meets once per week. The agenda for each meeting is prepared in an GitHub issue and the protocols of the meetings are collected in the [meetings folder](meetings/).

## Projects

Projects can join the OpenRail Association by using the [incubation process](incubation_process.md). Projects are supposed to adhere to certain standards to foster high quality projects which are useful to the sector. The barrier of entry is meant to be low, though. We want to provide an environment where projects can grow within the OpenRail Association.

We maintain a set of [project templates](project-templates/) which provides a baseline for projects joining the OpenRail Association in terms of governance according to open principles.

See the [official list of projects](projects.md) for which projects are already part of the OpenRail Association.
